# Dirty Emmet's Chop Shop

This website was designed for the fictious 
‘Dirty Emmet's Chop Shop’, a local barber in County Tipperary. 
The site supplies users with information about the business 
and the services that they provide. This is achieved using 
a business description and image gallery with a list of their 
services.

The website also allows the user the ability to
 get in contact with the business by listing their 
 contact details, social media links and the addition 
of a form for the user to leave a message to the business 
owners. The ability to book an appointment via a pop-up 
modal has also been included.



## UX

This website was designed for existing customers who wanted 
the business to have an online presence, and to attract 
potential new customers to the business by providing them 
with all the information they need to learn about 
‘Dirty Emmet’s Chop Shop’.

I wanted the website to do the following: 

* Be easy on the eye.

* Simple yet effective layout.

* Clear instructions for the user when involved in any 
interactive elements on the website.

* Not to bombard the user with an overload of information, 
but at the same time providing them with all the relevant 
information they would need.

Once all the commits in Gitpod were pushed to Github, I then 
began the process of Deployment of my project.

First, in Github, inside my repository for this project I 
selected 'settings'.

From there I scrolled down the page to the 'Githun Pages' 
section and change the source from 'none' to 'master branch'. 
This produced the following link for my live project:
